![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=Smart+Crop+Recommendation+System) <!-- Add a banner image if available -->

The **Smart Crop Recommendation System** is an AI-powered tool designed to help farmers make data-driven decisions about which crops to grow based on soil conditions, weather data, and other environmental factors. By leveraging machine learning and real-time weather data from the NASA POWER API, this system provides accurate and interpretable crop recommendations to maximize yield and reduce risks.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Crop Recommendation**: Predicts the best crop based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Integrates with the NASA POWER API to fetch current and historical weather data.
- **Interpretable AI**: Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to include more crops, regions, and features.

## How It Works üöÄ
1. **Data Collection**: The system uses a dataset containing soil and environmental features along with crop labels.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: A neural network is trained to predict the best crop based on input features.
4. **Weather Integration**: Real-time weather data is fetched using the NASA POWER API.
5. **Prediction**: The model recommends the best crop for the given conditions.
6. **Interpretation**: SHAP is used to explain the model's predictions.
